## COMP 294

This is my repository for COMP 294. The goal of this project is to convert an existing application written in [Processing](https://processing.org/) into Javascript and SVGs, relying as little as possible on additional libraries.

## Updates

- [Initial SVG Test](https://msquizzle.github.io/COMP-294/SVG-SAMPLES/svg-samples.html)
- [Chart 1](https://msquizzle.github.io/COMP-294/chart-samples/chart1.html)
- ~_Chart 2_~ _coming soon_

## Remaining Tasks

### Complete Charts
- ~Draw series~
- ~Add tool-tip on hover~
- ~Draw axes~
- ~Add labels/titles~
- ~Add colors to series~
- ~Add keys~
- Add hover animation to keys
- ~Add tooltip to keys~
- Add click functionality to keys
- Add ability to draw sections of charts (animations)

### Overall

- Add overall state configuration
- Animate initial drawing of charts
- Add listeners to update state
- Show/add/move charts based on state
- Documentation
- Stretch: semi-responsiveness?
