## COMP 294

This is my repository for COMP 294. The goal of this project is to convert an existing application written in [Processing](https://processing.org/) into Javascript and SVGs, relying as little as possible on additional libraries.

## Updates

- [Initial SVG Test](https://msquizzle.github.io/COMP-294/SVG-SAMPLES/svg-samples.html)
- [Chart 1](https://msquizzle.github.io/COMP-294/chart-samples/chart1.html)
- [Chart 2](https://msquizzle.github.io/COMP-294/chart-samples/chart2.html)

## Remaining Tasks

### Complete Charts
- _~~Draw series~~_
- _~~Add tool-tip on hover~~_
- _~~Draw axes~~_
- _~~Add labels/titles~~_
- _~~Add colors to series~~_
- _~~Add keys~~_
- _~~Add hover animation to keys~~_
- _~~Add tooltip to keys~~_

### Overall

- Add overall state configuration
- Animate initial drawing of charts
- Add listeners to update state
- Show/add/move charts based on state
- Documentation
- Stretch: semi-responsiveness?
